* NixOS Configuration

** Description

This Nix Flake houses my NixOS and Home-Manager configurations, for both a laptop and a homelab.

This allows me to have fully declarative and reproducible setups for my systems.

** Architecture

- The [[file:flake.nix][flake.nix]] file is the main entry-point. It specifies a set of inputs and outputs, and behaves like a pure function. The inputs (e.g. remote package repositories) are pulled, then hashed and saved to [[file:flake.lock][flake.lock]], asserting the same set of inputs across all my systems.
- For the overall architecture of my flake, I separate my concerns into:
  - Many individual modules providing some added feature or functionality (under [[file:modules/][./modules]]).
  - A set of Flags that chose to include or exclude each feature, on a per-host basis (in [[file:hosts/][./hosts/*/default.nix]]).
- This architecture allows for easily and maximally reducing duplicate code across my different systems, such that all host-unique configuration ends up under [[file:hosts/][./hosts]] with mostly only toggles for enabling modules.
